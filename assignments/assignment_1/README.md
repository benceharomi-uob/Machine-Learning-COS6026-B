# Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy with Machine Learning

The following study covers the implementation of a neural network machine learning
model which helps with the detection of diabetic retinopathy. This disease is the most common outcome of diabetes, and it can cause blindness if it is not detected in time. A previous
research (Antal & Hajdu 2014) proposed a Machine Learning model which helps with the detection of the disease at early stages. This essay investigates their findings from a different
aspect and presents a neural network that classifies the patients by the features of their retinal
images.
